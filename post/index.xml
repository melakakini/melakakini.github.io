      <description>Thanks to all the hardworking and creative theme makers that post to Hugo.
##shoutout thanks to you guys I get to have nice looking site. Thank you for your efforts I get my thoughts out.
But why?
Why should anyone crack their heads to provide FREE themes to others? Why spend nights perfecting their themes so that others can have beautiful websites?  It&amp;rsquo;s amazing! you guys rock.</description>
