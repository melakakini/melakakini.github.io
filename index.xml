      <description>#What a day! It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a day. An exciting day. A day that makes you wonder why would people keep reading while others keep churning out stuff. Won&amp;rsquo;t it be better to just sit and enjoy the day? Why take the effort to keep typing without knowing if these posts will ever be read or make a difference? Does everyone have so much to say? ###17.8.17### Interesting day. look at the repetition.</description>

      <description>#My second post Appernetic.io is a great site that uses the HUGO static site generator and enables us (non-developers) to have a website without a CMS like WordPress or Drupal. The pages are hosted at github pages while the images are hosted at cloudinary so appernetic would be likened to a conductor putting all together and churning out a website that&amp;rsquo;s statically generated. We write all posts in Mark Down (MD) instead of Mark Up (HTML) so that it would be simpler.</description>

      <description>Thanks to all the hardworking and creative theme makers that post to Hugo.
##shoutout thanks to you guys I get to have nice looking site. Thank you for your efforts I get my thoughts out.
But why?
Why should anyone crack their heads to provide FREE themes to others? Why spend nights perfecting their themes so that others can have beautiful websites?  It&amp;rsquo;s amazing! you guys rock.</description>

      <description>This is the first post and i have no clue what so ever what&amp;rsquo;s happening. Been typing the about section and now the first post section and am still wondering what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen to get it to happen. #update Have just seen the youtube &amp;ldquo;silent movie&amp;rdquo; style tutorial and published it but nothing is seen yet. WIll come back and test in 15 mins
Am back and today it&amp;rsquo;s the 28th of April and am not making much progress.</description>

      <description>This is the home file and how about some markdown Not even clear how -this- works So if I used bold Oh that&amp;rsquo;s cool. Appernetic allows me to edit with their editor menu without memorising the codes and i can even hearing aid links and now am impressed, How about
 Blockquotes and how this would affect the formattting? This is sad. Have still nothing to show for all the time on the internet.</description>

      <description>Am writing on appernetic to try out their features as I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling to get a site up with console/.terminal but without much success So this about section is about how I&amp;rsquo;m testing out appernetic for Melaka Kini News
This is me again writing in MD.  This is so cool. Appernetic replied to my messages on gitter. Shout out to Appernetic. It&amp;rsquo;s tough enough having to learn git and then hugo and then firebase and then appernetic comes along.</description>
